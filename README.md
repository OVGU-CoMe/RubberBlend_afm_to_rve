This Repository only contains one file, which is a function processing AFM images of filled binary elastomer blends to a format interpretable for an FEA tool.
It is associated with our contribution 'Modeling the Viscoelastic Properties of Filled Elastomer Blends' to the book 'Advances and Challenges in Computational Mechanics'.
